-- build-it --

build-it is a easy to use tool for building projects of all sizes easily

With a easy to use syntax and all it's features. build-it allows for compilation of files into object files which then are built into a executable. One of the best parts of this build system is that it only rebuilds the parts that you change. Which is a massive time saver.

What really sets this build system apart from others is that it is easy to setup, run and compile. The tool is fast and cross-platform support is as easy as just adding a new compiler for a designated OS and then just running.
